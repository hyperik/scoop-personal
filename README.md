# Personal Scoop

A [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) bucket for tools used for personal or non-commercial purposes. This project is a chimera of personal productivity and media tools, games and other ephemera. Some of the installers may be staged in corporate repositories, even if the licence is such that only licence-bearing users or usage may take place. This is to more cleanly separate from open-source and internal tools.

## Usage

After installing [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), enter the following line in a Command Prompt or PowerShell window:

```powershell
scoop bucket add <TBD>
```

Once this is done, you can install any app from this bucket.

For instance, use the following command:

```powershell
# Don't include the .json file extension in the app name
scoop install freeorion
```

## Updating applications in this bucket

For manifests that contain an `autoupdate` section, there's a GitHub Actions workflow that runs every day and commits updated manifests to the repository.

For manifests that don't contain an `autoupdate` section, you can also [add an `autoupdate` section to the manifest](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/wiki/App-Manifest-Autoupdate) to ensure the application always remains up-to-date in the future.

## Maintaining the versions

Since we don't want these to become very out of date, but don't want to actively manage this, we have a need to create a self-defined meta-structure in the manifests which we will use to maintain these effectively.

These are supported by two scripts `Seed-ManifestSources.ps1` which we can use to initially seed the enriched manifests from the local locations where they may be found. And `Update-PersonalBucket.ps1` which uses this structure and keeps them up to date to ensure we can periodically update all references en masse, keeping it usable.

These should provide a simplified surface to allow regular automated invocation if we desire.

### Using Seed-ManifestSources

This script builds up the initial data structures from local repos. It has several helper features as the exact schema extension I added went through a few evolutions and I used this with AI assistance to the script to keep it maintained. It can also be used to cleanup certain problems like duplicate empty nodes under comments.

Ideally after running the first time in a repo it's not needed again unless we're changing format.

### Using Update-PersonalBucket.ps1

This is what ought to be run periodically and shouldn't need arugments by default. However if it's the first time running for a while, the `-Interactive` option allows a little more surety in the validity of the changes to make.

## Scoop Bucket Review TODO

There are many, many scoop buckets out there - some with thousands of applications. It's unrealistic to have full coverage but any application I use should be packaged into this format and some of the think regarding auto-updating, etc. may have already been done, so look to example buckets for references and ideas.

This is a good way to have periodic tool discovery since the software space changes regularly.

NOTE: a lot of buckets are for purposes like Chinese proxy evasion or translated or non-commercial safe licences so please be careful in what is used and always inspect the base .json file and source of executables.

### Buckets to review

- <https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzzhaq%2Fscoop-av%22&o=false> - lots of .exe and decompilation resources
- <https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frizwan-r-r%2Fredesigned-fiesta%22&o=false> - development tools
